  summary: >
    This model takes all of the parameter/ input data from the user specifically for the urban flooding workflow. 
    This data is then propogated through the model, reducing user input.

    All data/ choices made by the user are inputted at this stage of the model to reduce user error. 
    This process simplifies the user input methods.

      - name: RAINFALL_MODE
        title: Rainfall mode
        type: string
        description:
          If `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "return_period" then the rainfall depth corresponding to the `DURATION` and `RETURN_PERIOD` are extracted from the relevant CSV file in the `future-drainage` dataslot.
          If the `TIME_HORIZON` is anything other than "baseline", the rainfall depth is then uplifted by the percentage given in the CSV file.
          If `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "total_depth" then the `TOTAL_DEPTH` parameter is used to define the amount of rainfall and the `RETURN_PERIOD` and `TIME_HORIZON` parameters are ignored.
          The rainfall depth value, either directly provided or extracted from FUTURE-DRAINAGE, is used to generate a storm profile in combination with the summer profile and `DURATION` parameter.
        default: return_period
        required: true
        options:

        title: Return Period (years)
        description:
          The return period of the rainfall event.
          This parameter is only used if `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "return_period".
          If this is provided, then data must be present in the `future-drainage` dataslot.
          This return period is used to extract a rainfall depth from the FUTURE-DRAINAGE dataset and select the percentage uplift if required.
        type: string
        default: '100'

      - name: DURATION
        title: Duration (hours)
        description:
          The duration of the rainfall event.
          This value is used in combination with the rainfall depth and summer profile to generate a storm profile.
          If `RAINFALL_MODE` is "return_period", this value is also used to extract a rainfall depth from FUTURE-DRAINAGE.
          Only specific values are available as there is a limited number of durations within FUTURE-DRAINAGE.
        type: string
        default: '1'

        title: Post-event Duration (hours)
        description:
          The duration of the dry period following the rainfall event.
          After the rainfall event ends, CityCAT will continue to run for this period of time.
          This is to allow water to continue propogating and accumulating on the floodplain.

      - name: OPEN_BOUNDARIES
        title: Open Boundaries
        description:
          If `OPEN_BOUNDARIES` is "True", water will be allowed to leave the domain at the edges.
          If it is "False", water will bounce back from the edges of the domain and cannot leave.

        type: string
        description:
          If `PERMEABLE_AREAS` is set to "polygons", polygons from the `green_areas` dataslot are used to define areas which are permeable.
          Otherwise, all cells are treated as being "permeable" or "impermeable", depending on the selection.
        default: polygons
        required: true
        options:
          - name: polygons

        title: Time horizon
        description:
          The time horizon to use when selecting rainfall uplifts, baseline indicates no uplift.

      - name: DISCHARGE
        title: Discharge (m3/s)
        description:
          Value of discharge boundary condition, if provided then the `flow_polygons` dataslot is required.
          Discharge is distributed uniformly over the `DURATION` and gets multiplied by the number of cell boundaries intersected by the polygons in the `flow_polygons` dataslot.
          Therefore, it is normally advisable to divide the total desired discharge by the number of overlapping cell boundaries.
